'Have you ever lifted the hood of your car and noticed a label calling out specifications for your mobile A/C system? Did you ever wonder why it was there? Your cars manufacturer put that label in the engine compartment in compliance with a standard set by SAE International. It is SAE â€œJâ€ standard .The label is also required by some regulatory state and federal authorities. Avoid removing this label from your car. Look closely at the label photograph above. Notice the label recommends professional service for the air conditioning system. There are two basic reasons for professional service  first a personal safety concern as the system is under pressure and can cause injury and second the refrigerant charge and refrigerant lubricant amount are critical to system performance. Notice it identifies the refrigerant in this particular vehicle as HFC-a and tells the service professional the refrigerant capacity in both ounces and grams. It also calls out the plus (+)  minus (-) tolerance  this means the sytem will still function properly within this range of over/under refrigerant charge. Look to the far right of the label  in this column the type of compressor lubricant is called out for the service technician so he knows exactly what type and how much to add to the system.',negative

'WHEN TO REPLACE YOUR CABIN AIR FILTER The cabin air filter is a feature found on most  model vehicles  cleans the air that comes into the interior through the heating  ventilation and air-conditioning system. It catches dust  pollen and other airborne material that can make riding in a car unpleasant  particularly if you have allergies or other respiratory problems. Manufacturer recommend every   or   miles  others longer â€” and how often can depend on how much you drive and area where there is lot of dust. Some signs that you need a new cabin air filter are reduced air flow through your climate control system  such as when you crank up the fan too high and get more noise than results. Another is persistent bad odors. Even if you dont have these warnings  you should have the filter checked at least every  month  and you may be able to do that yourself. Depending on how long the filter has been in service  you might be shocked at what you see: leaves  twigs  insects  soot and grime that literally cover the entire surface that comes in contact with incoming air and also your evaporator coil  before you know it the leaves and insect will stick on your evaporator coil after some while the coil will be weak then it will start leaking.

'I recently changed the flywhweel and torgue converter of my nissan primera P- car. Its year  wagon and engine size is .. CVT transmission. But the mechanic ignorantly and forcefully cut out the two wires on the connector on dropping resistor on the transmission when he separated engine from transmission during the repair work. The connector got stuck together and we had to remove the connector and join the wires only. I actually ran a scan before the connector wires were reconnected and got P. That time the car was driving with a lot of difficulties and the   sport   mode was unusually flashing on the dashboard. The part number of the dropping resistor is -E. But the connector that was conmected to a metal on the resistor was eventually removed before we could reconnect the wires back. After the wires were connected the car drives better  the   sport   mode flashing stopped and the code went away. The only issue left is that the CVT is not selecting properly again. No codes left after I re-scanned it. The car now drives without selecting the gears. Engine revs at RPM for car speed of /km/h as against RPM for car speed of /km/h before we did the flywheel/ converter replacement. I have drained the transmission oil two times and cleaned the magnetic filters and refill but there still no improvement. The transmission oil is still light red and clean for I changed around six months ago and the car has covered less than km. Please what can I check again?',positive

'webmaster: OK Guys  so I had an interesting experience with my  FX yesterday. Was driving on MB at night and all of a sudden the car could not accelerate anymore  checked the dash board and noticed the dash board lights were on and the brakes as well as steering started getting hard. I knew the car has just gone off. I managed to navigate to the edge of the bridge and switched off the car. Started the engine and the car started but went off immediately. Tried doing it again but this time around pressing the accelerator to rev the engine in order to stop it from going off again but the engine wont rev and car died. I Then called my mechanic and described what happened and he told me to check the filter in my airflow meter to confirm if it was torn and alas it was torn and worn out. Was told to remove the filter and start the car and to my greatest surprise everything was back in order and car moved fine. Drove it home with no issues after removing the torn filter. Had to go get a replacement filter this morning. Just to share this piece with my Infiniti FX users  never knew a torn filter would cause a car to behave like this way.Yes  alls well that ends well. Filter in airflow meter? What filter is that. Would you mean the common air filter? If so  beats me how you neglected it for so long to get to such state of dilapidation.',positive

'The Importance of Car Air-Conditioner Maintenance by mosbus cool If your car has an air conditioner  and it most likely does  then it is important to get routine maintenance done on it. Many people donâ€™t think much about their car air conditioner until they need it and itâ€™s not performing correctly. But the best way to keep it performing at its best is to get routine maintenance done as needed. Routine maintenance is important for every car air conditioner for several reasons  including: â€¢ Keeping it cool. There are a number of problems that can lead to an air conditioner not working as well as it should. Before it becomes a problem these issues can usually be addressed through routine maintenance. That way you never miss a beat in the heat. â€¢ Keeping it clean. When you have a clean air conditioning unit you will help to keep it in good running order. Routine maintenance will keep the hoses and belt clean and running as they should. â€¢ Keeping it from getting worse. Routine maintenance on your car air conditioner will help us catch problems right away  rather than them compounding and getting worse. The sooner you can catch and fix a problem  the better off you will be in the long run. â€¢ Keeping up the value. You paid additional money to have an air conditioner in your vehicle. The good news is that it will help keep the value of your car up if you take care of it. Once you go to sell the vehicle it is a plus if you can demonstrate that you have had routine maintenance performed  including having it done on the car air conditioner. â€¢ Keeping you comfortable. One of the best reasons to keep up on air conditioning maintenance is so that you can actually enjoy the cool air. Being able to beat the heat on a hot summer day is worth the little bit of effort it takes to keep your carâ€™s air conditioner maintained. The good news is that routine maintenance and inspections on your carâ€™s air conditioner is as simple as giving the Keepinâ€™ Cool Auto Air-Conditioning Specialist a call. We are fully equipped professional. We can take care of all your air conditioning needs while you work or do other things.we will be glad to help keep your car air conditioning maintained and pleasantly cool!

'Flushing and Cleaning the A/C System Once an AC system has been contaminated or has suffered a failure  the most important part of the AC service to restore the cooling performance to the system = FLUSHING WITHOUT proper flushing procedures  seizing a new or rebuilt compressor is a real possibility. What is flushing ? Flushing is performed in order to remove all contamination (dirt) from the system. The smallest particle of contamination cause restriction and problems for a good function of the replaced compressor. It takes less than / of a teaspoon of debris (dirt) to completely restrict flow of refrigerant and oil in the typical auto AC system. Cleanliness and proper flushing procedures are very important Why / When flushing ? The AC compressor must be lubricated at all times. The AC compressor is the only moving part in the entire system and the only reason for oil in the system. The oil is being circulated throughout the system  that means that all the components (condenser  hoses  tubes  evaporator  drier  accumulator) have some coating of oil internally. If any dirt  debris or contamination happened in the system all components are affected . Removing the oil (and oil film inside the components) will eliminate all of the contamination from the AC system. Itâ€™s the oil that attracts and holds contaminants within the system. Remove the old oil = remove the contamination. The AC system must be flushed whenever the AC compressor is being replaced/removed or whenever there is indication of contamination within the system. Make it a habit to remove and inspect the orifice tube (if the system is so equipped). The orifice tube inlet filter screen will always tell a story about the condition of the auto AC system. Any debris or foreign material found on the orifice tube should cause you to look for other indications of contamination.Dismantle AC system and remove components not being flushed Never attempt to flush the following : . High side muffler assemblies . Receiver driers . Accumulators . Compressor . Expansion valves or orifice tubes The condenser and evaporator should be changed pending on how thick the contamination is in the system and also if the car uses electronic valve control switch I advice you change the condenser and evaporator.

'pek: For those of you following drummas FX issue  here is the update. I got interested in his issue when he mentioned he has tested several ECU and the car didnt start. I specifically told him that it is only the right one that will work. He contacted me and we agreed on me getting the brainbox from me. I sent someone to his place with the Right brainbox after it has been reprogrammed. Unfortunately  it didnt work. I told him we have to go with the scanner to detect the fault. Today is the fourth day and it is either we cant get the key or his mechanic wont be around. We even had to go with other brainbox to test. Today  we were able to trace the fault and rectify. The car started fine. His mechanic was surprised. We noticed the car wasnt performing optimally. It was discovered two nozzle were bad. Current was entering but it was not spraying. We interchanged the nozzle and got the same result. The mechanic was there all the time  relaying info to drumma. How is it brainbox? Hm. Didnt realize Part II was going to start almost immediately. Kidding. I dont want to be a cast in the plot  Im just interested in learning. So my observations are these: (i) Were the two nozzles bad before the new repairs? (ii) Could it be that those nozzles are not now optimally operational because the ecm is defective in the relevant section? (iii) What did you determine was the vehicles fault?

'Kingsteve: Forget about the number of complaints for now  and look at the reason for their complaints...numbers are secondary  reason for the complaints  primary. Most common problems reported were...transmission issues  Radiator issues (leaking  overheating  coolant mixing with transmission)  excessive oil consumption  and Engine problems. However  from the Infiniti complaints  youll hardly find the aforementioned problems  rather the type of problems they complained about were  accessories problems  eg: dashboard cracks  leather cracks on seats (common with the FX)  electrical problems on select models (G)  Brakes wearing out prematurely  and few other complaints  which in my opinion  are manageable! Lets put it this way  the Infiniti complaints are not as severe as the Nissan brand. It has nothing to do with sheer volume of sales...the problems are there. However  Nissan have tried to rectify some of those common problems on their newer models  but the question is: how many people can really afford to buy the newer models  especially in Africa  where everything is cash n carry? EDIT: Before I got my Infiniti sedan  I really wanted an SUV...be it Pathfinder or Xterra  but after reading the horrible reviews about most Nissan products  I did the needful. I then started researching on their luxury brand...Infiniti  surprisingly  the reviews were ok  not perfect  but something I could live with. I then made up my mind to get the FX or FX  but I also got discouraged by the price  and also the cracking dashboards. I finally got the M sedan  which has the FX engine. A solid car  with loads of gadgets and ehh...gimmicks  the only problem; ground clearance is low  which means  some roads are prohibited. I have a second car for my daily movement  so I can live with that. Nissan products are generally flashy  hence; my initial attraction to the brand  but reliability is highly questionable! Lol  I see your point sha  makes sense.... ',positive

Since you forded water with it at the turn of a steering  there is a wheezing noise.

Yea... The steering does feel hard. Im sorry; I really dont know what a rack and pinion is and I am yet to actually identify where the noise is coming from...
