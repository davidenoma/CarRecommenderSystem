'Costee: Am I missing something here? How do bad cats come into this saga? Your codes do not show bad cats. They are all related to your oxygen sensors: they're either bad or the connections are shorted. Only one sensor appears to be free  BS. You have two cats  might as well gut them for now. The only thing I find puzzling though is that the code P is not applicable to the VK engine that yours is since you have an FX. Maybe it's of little consequence. Dunno. Or maybe the new ECM...

'Have you ever lifted the hood of your car and noticed a label calling out specifications for your mobile A/C system? Did you ever wonder why it was there? Your carâ€™s manufacturer put that label in the engine compartment in compliance with a standard set by SAE International. It is SAE â€œJâ€ standard .The label is also required by some regulatory state and federal authorities. Avoid removing this label from your car. Look closely at the label photograph above. Notice the label recommends professional service for the air conditioning system. There are two basic reasons for professional service  first a personal safety concern as the system is under pressure and can cause injury and second the refrigerant charge and refrigerant lubricant amount are critical to system performance. Notice it identifies the refrigerant in this particular vehicle as HFC-a and tells the service professional the refrigerant capacity in both ounces and grams. It also calls out the plus (+)  minus (-) tolerance  this means the sytem will still function properly within this range of over/under refrigerant charge. Look to the far right of the label  in this column the type of compressor lubricant is called out for the service technician so he knows exactly what type and how much to add to the system.',negetive

'WHEN TO REPLACE YOUR CABIN AIR FILTER The cabin air filter is a feature found on most  model vehicles  cleans the air that comes into the interior through the heating  ventilation and air-conditioning system. It catches dust  pollen and other airborne material that can make riding in a car unpleasant  particularly if you have allergies or other respiratory problems. Manufacturer recommend every   or   miles  others longer â€” and how often can depend on how much you drive and area where there is lot of dust. Some signs that you need a new cabin air filter are reduced air flow through your climate control system  such as when you crank up the fan too high and get more noise than results. Another is persistent bad odors. Even if you don't have these warnings  you should have the filter checked at least every  month  and you may be able to do that yourself. Depending on how long the filter has been in service  you might be shocked at what you see: leaves  twigs  insects  soot and grime that literally cover the entire surface that comes in contact with incoming air and also your evaporator coil  before you know it the leaves and insect will stick on your evaporator coil after some while the coil will be weak then it will start leaking. Here is a picture of what damage the LEXUS RX evaporator  just changed it today.',negetive
'eaglechild: I have  maxima which i got six years ago. I love the car and i'm attached to it. I changed the timing chain last year and it has been performing like a  cylinder instead of a v. I want to change the engine  any idea of the cost of a top grade one. Do i also need to change the gear box? It is not giving any probs though. I have a camry but i find it boring. I need my maxima back till i can get a new one. Actually thinking of switching to a .L V Altima. STOP STOP STOP. Converting from maxima . to . is a big headache and not an easy job. Buy your engine and drop it in. Why did you change the timing chain? it is a life time item. I have owned couple of that maximas and i never did a timing chain.

'Thank you very much for your advice. I appreciate. nissparts: Check engine light has nothing to do with changing engine oil (mostly) You need a diagnostic scanner to detect what the check light is coming on for and only a fix would turn it off. Smelling oil through the vents is a bad sign. I hope the engine oil was not overfilled. ABS light also means there is a fault with the braking system. A scanner can also point out exactly where the issue is. I strongly recommend you download the user and service manual for the Murano and learn as much as you can about the vehicle. It does not take kindly to novice errors.',neutral

'I recently changed the flywhweel and torgue converter of my nissan primera P- car. Its year  wagon and engine size is .. CVT transmission. But the mechanic ignorantly and forcefully cut out the two wires on the connector on dropping resistor on the transmission when he separated engine from transmission during the repair work. The connector got stuck together and we had to remove the connector and join the wires only. I actually ran a scan before the connector wires were reconnected and got P. That time the car was driving with a lot of difficulties and the   sport   mode was unusually flashing on the dashboard. The part number of the dropping resistor is -E. But the connector that was conmected to a metal on the resistor was eventually removed before we could reconnect the wires back. After the wires were connected the car drives better  the   sport   mode flashing stopped and the code went away. The only issue left is that the CVT is not selecting properly again. No codes left after I re-scanned it. The car now drives without selecting the gears. Engine revs at RPM for car speed of /km/h as against RPM for car speed of /km/h before we did the flywheel/ converter replacement. I have drained the transmission oil two times and cleaned the magnetic filters and refill but there still no improvement. The transmission oil is still light red and clean for I changed around six months ago and the car has covered less than km. Please what can I check again?',positive

Audi produces % galvanised cars to prevent corrosion  and was the first mass-market vehicle to do so  following introduction of the process by Porsche. Along with other precautionary measures  the full-body zinc coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust.

'webmaster: OK Guys  so I had an interesting experience with my  FX yesterday. Was driving on MB at night and all of a sudden the car could not accelerate anymore  checked the dash board and noticed the dash board lights were on and the brakes as well as steering started getting hard. I knew the car has just gone off. I managed to navigate to the edge of the bridge and switched off the car. Started the engine and the car started but went off immediately. Tried doing it again but this time around pressing the accelerator to rev the engine in order to stop it from going off again but the engine wont rev and car died. I Then called my mechanic and described what happened and he told me to check the filter in my airflow meter to confirm if it was torn and alas it was torn and worn out. Was told to remove the filter and start the car and to my greatest surprise everything was back in order and car moved fine. Drove it home with no issues after removing the torn filter. Had to go get a replacement filter this morning. Just to share this piece with my Infiniti FX users  never knew a torn filter would cause a car to behave like this way.Yes  all's well that ends well. Filter in airflow meter? What filter is that. Would you mean the common air filter? If so  beats me how you neglected it for so long to get to such state of dilapidation.',positive
