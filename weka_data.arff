'Costee: Am I missing something here? How do bad cats come into this saga? Your codes do not show bad cats. They are all related to your oxygen sensors: they're either bad or the connections are shorted. Only one sensor appears to be free  BS. You have two cats  might as well gut them for now. The only thing I find puzzling though is that the code P is not applicable to the VK engine that yours is since you have an FX. Maybe it's of little consequence. Dunno. Or maybe the new ECM...

'Have you ever lifted the hood of your car and noticed a label calling out specifications for your mobile A/C system? Did you ever wonder why it was there? Your carâ€™s manufacturer put that label in the engine compartment in compliance with a standard set by SAE International. It is SAE â€œJâ€ standard .The label is also required by some regulatory state and federal authorities. Avoid removing this label from your car. Look closely at the label photograph above. Notice the label recommends professional service for the air conditioning system. There are two basic reasons for professional service  first a personal safety concern as the system is under pressure and can cause injury and second the refrigerant charge and refrigerant lubricant amount are critical to system performance. Notice it identifies the refrigerant in this particular vehicle as HFC-a and tells the service professional the refrigerant capacity in both ounces and grams. It also calls out the plus (+)  minus (-) tolerance  this means the sytem will still function properly within this range of over/under refrigerant charge. Look to the far right of the label  in this column the type of compressor lubricant is called out for the service technician so he knows exactly what type and how much to add to the system.                                        ,negetive'

'WHEN TO REPLACE YOUR CABIN AIR FILTER The cabin air filter is a feature found on most  model vehicles  cleans the air that comes into the interior through the heating  ventilation and air-conditioning system. It catches dust  pollen and other airborne material that can make riding in a car unpleasant  particularly if you have allergies or other respiratory problems. Manufacturer recommend every   or   miles  others longer â€” and how often can depend on how much you drive and area where there is lot of dust. Some signs that you need a new cabin air filter are reduced air flow through your climate control system  such as when you crank up the fan too high and get more noise than results. Another is persistent bad odors. Even if you don't have these warnings  you should have the filter checked at least every  month  and you may be able to do that yourself. Depending on how long the filter has been in service  you might be shocked at what you see: leaves  twigs  insects  soot and grime that literally cover the entire surface that comes in contact with incoming air and also your evaporator coil  before you know it the leaves and insect will stick on your evaporator coil after some while the coil will be weak then it will start leaking.

It is also easy to evade possible aggravation. â€¢ To Facilitate Best Cooling Effect- For normal cooling effect in your car  the conditioning system has to be in the right condition. To avoid any deterioration in the performance of the conditioning system  it would be best to have it checked.

'@idaraCHOBD The thermostat's job is relatively simple  but extremely important. It regulates the engine's operating temperature. It does this by restricting the flow of coolant from the engine back to the radiator. The thermostat is usually located in a housing where the upper radiator hose is connected to the engine. The thermostat is a valve that is held shut by spring tension. A wax filled thermal element in the thermostat opens the valve. As the engine begins to warm up and the coolant gets hot  the wax inside the sealed element expands and pushes the thermostat valve open. This occurs at a preset temperature (typically  degrees F. or so)  which is usually stamped on the thermostat itself. The thermostat should be fully open about  degrees F. above the rated temperature. The opening of the thermostat allows coolant to circulate through the engine and cooling system. As the temperature of the coolant begins to drop  the wax element cools off and contracts allowing the thermostat to partially or fully close. Thus  by cycling open and shut a relatively constant operating temperature is maintained.                                       ,negetive'
'austinreal: Upon scanning the car  it only gave me a p error codeCheck the ECT sensor. Or even the temperature gauge. So long as the hot water/coolant does not bubble out from your radiator you might as well let the issue rest for now.

'The Importance of Car Air-Conditioner Maintenance by mosbus cool If your car has an air conditioner  and it most likely does  then it is important to get routine maintenance done on it. Many people donâ€™t think much about their car air conditioner until they need it and itâ€™s not performing correctly. But the best way to keep it performing at its best is to get routine maintenance done as needed. Routine maintenance is important for every car air conditioner for several reasons  including: â€¢ Keeping it cool. There are a number of problems that can lead to an air conditioner not working as well as it should. Before it becomes a problem these issues can usually be addressed through routine maintenance. That way you never miss a beat in the heat. â€¢ Keeping it clean. When you have a clean air conditioning unit you will help to keep it in good running order. Routine maintenance will keep the hoses and belt clean and running as they should. â€¢ Keeping it from getting worse. Routine maintenance on your car air conditioner will help us catch problems right away  rather than them compounding and getting worse. The sooner you can catch and fix a problem  the better off you will be in the long run. â€¢ Keeping up the value. You paid additional money to have an air conditioner in your vehicle. The good news is that it will help keep the value of your car up if you take care of it. Once you go to sell the vehicle it is a plus if you can demonstrate that you have had routine maintenance performed  including having it done on the car air conditioner. â€¢ Keeping you comfortable. One of the best reasons to keep up on air conditioning maintenance is so that you can actually enjoy the cool air. Being able to beat the heat on a hot summer day is worth the little bit of effort it takes to keep your carâ€™s air conditioner maintained. The good news is that routine maintenance and inspections on your carâ€™s air conditioner is as simple as giving the Keepinâ€™ Cool Auto Air-Conditioning Specialist a call. We are fully equipped professional. We can take care of all your air conditioning needs while you work or do other things.we will be glad to help keep your car air conditioning maintained and pleasantly cool!                                      ,negetive'

I got interested in his issue when he mentioned he has tested several ECU and the car didn't start. I specifically told him that it is only the right one that will work. He contacted me and we agreed on me getting the brainbox from me. I sent someone to his place with the Right brainbox after it has been reprogrammed. Unfortunately  it didn't work. I told him we have to go with the scanner to detect the fault. Today is the fourth day and it is either we can't get the key or his mechanic won't be around. We even had to go with other brainbox to test. Today  we were able to trace the fault and rectify. The car started fine. His mechanic was surprised. We noticed the car wasn't performing optimally. It was discovered two nozzle were bad. Current was entering but it was not spraying. We interchanged the nozzle and got the same result. The mechanic was there all the time  relaying info to drumma.

'Flushing and Cleaning the A/C System Once an AC system has been contaminated or has suffered a failure  the most important part of the AC service to restore the cooling performance to the system = FLUSHING WITHOUT proper flushing procedures  seizing a new or rebuilt compressor is a real possibility. What is flushing ? Flushing is performed in order to remove all contamination (dirt) from the system. The smallest particle of contamination cause restriction and problems for a good function of the replaced compressor. It takes less than / of a teaspoon of debris (dirt) to completely restrict flow of refrigerant and oil in the typical auto AC system. Cleanliness and proper flushing procedures are very important Why / When flushing ? The AC compressor must be lubricated at all times. The AC compressor is the only moving part in the entire system and the only reason for oil in the system. The oil is being circulated throughout the system  that means that all the components (condenser  hoses  tubes  evaporator  drier  accumulator) have some coating of oil internally. If any dirt  debris or contamination happened in the system all components are affected . Removing the oil (and oil film inside the components) will eliminate all of the contamination from the AC system. Itâ€™s the oil that attracts and holds contaminants within the system. Remove the old oil = remove the contamination. The AC system must be flushed whenever the AC compressor is being replaced/removed or whenever there is indication of contamination within the system. Make it a habit to remove and inspect the orifice tube (if the system is so equipped). The orifice tube inlet filter screen will always tell a story about the condition of the auto AC system. Any debris or foreign material found on the orifice tube should cause you to look for other indications of contamination.Dismantle AC system and remove components not being flushed Never attempt to flush the following : . High side muffler assemblies . Receiver driers . Accumulators . Compressor . Expansion valves or orifice tubes The condenser and evaporator should be changed pending on how thick the contamination is in the system and also if the car uses electronic valve control switch I advice you change the condenser and evaporator.                                  ,negetive'

'OK Guys  so I had an interesting experience with my  FX yesterday. Was driving on MB at night and all of a sudden the car could not accelerate anymore  checked the dash board and noticed the dash board lights were on and the brakes as well as steering started getting hard. I knew the car has just gone off. I managed to navigate to the edge of the bridge and switched off the car. Started the engine and the car started but went off immediately. Tried doing it again but this time around pressing the accelerator to rev the engine in order to stop it from going off again but the engine wont rev and car died. I Then called my mechanic and described what happened and he told me to check the filter in my airflow meter to confirm if it was torn and alas it was torn and worn out. Was told to remove the filter and start the car and to my greatest surprise everything was back in order and car moved fine. Drove it home with no issues after removing the torn filter. Had to go get a replacement filter this morning. Just to share this piece with my Infiniti FX users  never knew a torn filter would cause a car to behave like this way.                                         ,negetive'

Ran a diagnostic checks today and got the following codes Â· P Â· P Â· P Â· P Noticeable symptoms Â· Car accelerates slowly when starting up and when climbing steeply hill or bridge even if the accelerator is pressed to the floor. Â· Engine shuts down mostly at slow speeds when the car starts up- (the lights on dashboard remains on) Â· speedometer drops to zero when speed limits reaches like kmh. at this point the yellow key light comes on but the car continue driving but seems to lose power. Â· Steering wheel hard a little Â· The transmission still selects gear. can anyone help with the above.P is to be most dreaded because it just might be the beginning of the end of the cvt.

'Car Air Conditioner Maintenance Tips for maintaining a car air conditioner Prolong the life of your air conditioner by running it at least once a week to assist in keeping the compressor seals lubricated  which will prevent refrigerant from leaking. Your air conditioning system not only cools your vehicle  one of its primary functions is to remove humidity from the cabin. In other words  use your air conditioner in winter to keep your windscreen free from fog. When driving on the open road it is always a good idea to have your car air conditioner set to   flow through   ventilation and not   recirculate  .

If the one you have there now doesn't then it's not your car's specifically  though it's compatible enough to do other or basic functions. For now  I'd suggest you attend to the oxygen sensors.

'Lomomike  I had a shortage of the transmission fluid (don't know if it was leaking at that time) which made the gearbox struggle before it changes into fourth gear especially on high speed. So I complained the issue to my mechanic and he suggested that we should top up the fluid  I agreed. He bought liter of dexron iii ATF from oando and topped it up (used all of it). This happened four days ago  I travelled to kaduna on friday with the car and the gearbox was shifting smoothly and perfectly. So yesterday I floored the car to see how quick the gearbox shifts at high RPM  it worked perfectly until It got to rd gear (throttle still on floor) the rpm got to  in rd gear @ kmph but refused to shift to th gear  the car jerked at that moment  rpm went down quickly asif the car was no longer in gear. But when I marched the throttle gently the car shifted to th gear nicely. So When I got home I decided to check under the car to see if something was wrong. The leak was what I found under the car  I just hope this is a minor issue. Thanks                                     ,neutral'

I quickly checked the service manual to find out the responsible fuse and discovered it was blown. I replaced the fuse all systems good to go and after two minutes the fuse gave up. This happened with three more fuses getting blown on a car which was in the OFF position. I did my best to look for any grounding problem and couldn't find anything so I decided to get a rewire.

'Symptoms of a Bad or Failing Ambient Temperature Sensor (Switch) Common signs include a faulty AC auto mode  inconsistent cooling  and incorrect outdoor temperature readings. Modern vehicles are equipped with sophisticated heating and air conditioning systems that are highly efficient in achieving and maintaining comfortable cabin temperatures for the passengers. They are able to do this by using a series of sensors that work together to activate and regulate the AC system. One of the primary sensors that plays a key role in the operation of the AC system is the ambient temperature sensor  also commonly known as the ambient temperature sensor switch. Vehicles in hot or cold extremes will require significantly more effort from the HVAC system to both cool and heat the cabin of the vehicle. For this reason  it is important for the system to be aware of the temperature of the environment that the vehicle is in. It is the job of the ambient temperature sensor to measure the external temperature of the vehicle as a reference point for the computer to make calculations. The computer will continuously monitor the signal from the ambient temperature sensor and make automatic adjustments as needed to maintain cabin temperature. When the ambient temperature sensor fails  there will usually be a few symptoms that may alert the driver that a problem with the sensor has occurred and it should be inspected or replaced if needed. . The AC auto mode will not work Most modern vehicles have an auto AC setting that will allow the vehicle to automatically set and regulate the temperature. The AC system will simply read the ambient and cabin temperature sensors data and continuously cycle the AC system on and off as required to keep the cabin cool. When the ambient temperature sensor fails  the system does not have a reference point from which to base itâ€™s automatic calculations and the setting will not work. . Inconsistent cooling Another symptom of a bad or failing ambient temperature sensor is inconsistent cooling. As the ambient temperature sensor plays a direct role in the automated function of the AC system  when it is having a problem this may interfere with the systemâ€™s ability to cool the vehicle. If the ambient temperature sensor fails or is sending out an inconsistent signal  then the AC system may have trouble maintaining cool and comfortable cabin temperatures. . Incorrect reading on temperature gauge Another more obvious symptom of a bad or failing sensor is an incorrect reading on the vehicleâ€™s temperature gauge. Most vehicles will have some sort of display somewhere on the interior of the vehicle that indicates the outside temperature of the vehicle  usually read by the ambient temperature sensor. If the reading on the gauge or indicator is off by more than a few degrees  then the sensor should be replaced  as the incorrect reading may interfere with proper AC system functions. The ambient temperature sensor plays an important role in the overall operation of the AC system. For this reason  if you suspect that your ambient temperature sensor has failed  or is having a problem. Contact MOSBUS COOL to help inspect the AC system and replace the sensor if necessary.                               ,positive'

'Run your air conditioner weekly. On a weekly basis  turn the air conditioning on and let it run for approximately  minutes. Set the temperature to the coolest setting and the fan on the quickest speed. This will help to keep the gas pressure at its optimum level and the compressor in tiptop condition  reducing the chance of a mechanical problem from developing. If your carâ€™s air conditioning has a defrost setting  it is also worth running this for  minutes every week  to help to remove moisture from the system and thereby prevent the build-up of mildew. Youâ€™ll enjoy air conditioning that is fresher and less prone to emitting unpleasant smells that will affect the comfort and enjoyment of your journeys.

A camry can do km/h and wont go off the road except a novice is behind the wheel. However  its not nice running at such speeds in Nigeria. Toyota tune their suspension and steering towards comfort and not sports  hence that light uneasy feel when doing high speeds.

'nissparts: Check if the sensor in yours has  or  pins in the connector I spoke to someone over here who told me he has it in stock  but before I thought of leaving to get it  I wanted to do a thorough check again to make sure I wasn't replacing something that isn't bad. I made another mechanic close to my house go under the car and check the sensors  he saw one at the front  close to the bumper disconnected. It has a green -pin plug. He connected it back and ensured that the back one was in place too. I decided to drive the car around for a few minutes if I'll notice any changes  but I only got a . MPG gain which was normal because the car was fluctuating between . MPG and  MPG in between use of regular and premium fuel. When I came back from the short test drive  I told him to disconnect the battery terminals  and replace them again (hoping to reset the whole system). He did that and when I checked my screen if there was any changes  the MPG was showing *.* (which was what I expected as he has just removed the battery terminals and the system has not been able to calculate the MPG since I've not driven it). The DTE (Distance To Empty) was on the same number before the terminal removal. So I told him I needed to drive the car for the whole day and check for changes which I did and I bought premium fuel. During the test drive  I noticed the MPG was increasing slowly which I expected  but to my surprise  later at night  I crossed my usual . and even my best of . MPG and recorded . MPG before I got home. Now  here's my question. Considering my increasing MPG  could there still be a problem? Are the sensors working as they should or do I still need to replace them. I could have gone to scan them but it costs alot and I was considering to get a cheap scanner instead of always going to pay for scanning. I found someone who sells the scanning software and USB cable that will enable me to use my laptop as a scanner. I don't know if that is reliable so I would need your advise. I believe the more I keep driving the car  the more MPG I'll get but one more thing is  the MPG starts reducing slowly too when I'm idling. Please let me know if there's anything I have to do next.

'So I'm back again and now to give a full breakdown of how my car came back to life as a result of the team work from my mechanic and pek's team.... and unlike what he wrote earlier about defamation or no defamation.... I still stand my ground on what i said as everything came to play when i was there on saturday..... Fast forward to friday  the ECM they brought luckily started the car but the car was not functioning at its normal pace.... but they insisted we pay for the ECM because their job was done after much argument ensued between pek's boys and my mechanic they resolved to collect half of the said payment and they said it was the ignition throttle that was faulty and wasn't making the car work well.... so we agreed when they fixed that and the car works perfectly  they will get their balance. So another of their boss called me and said he doesn't trust my mechanic that he will have his boys work on the injecto nozzle at an extra cost of   which i decided no to argue but consented to pay just because i want the car to work..... finally they changed the nozzle and started the car but it was still the same.... and after much trial and errors pek's boy said it wasn't the nozzle again that its discharging well and the current is perfect but that the valve is damaged hence they have to open the engine to fix the valve. This was the start of another hrs argument between the guy and my mechanic and even my girl friend's mum had to come out to contribute her own quota after all the back and forth my mechanic said he wasn't going to pay them anything until he fixed the valve they said wasn't working.... this was when their bosses became agitated and were giving me all manners of david & goliath stories of how they've finished their job and I should pay..... meanwhile my mechanic was trying to give scenarios of how it might not be the valve but they took him for a fool like he didn't know what he was saying.... I tried putting a call through to pek at that point but he wasn't picking.... called Adeiza and his was turned off so we were left to decide what to do then..... I don't know what got into my mechanic's spirit at that point that made him call his own rewire and the guy now told him they should check all the coil cables to ensure they all positioned accurately... then my mechanic told pek's guy and he went to check and he realized he didn't fix the cables appropriately.... now once that was done the car fired up nicely and they were shocked that the same idiot they ridiculed was the one who saved their asses with all their trial and error..... The part that got me vexed was when I now got a message that their boss said they should tell me he was sorry for the arguments that ensued..... I am not mad or upset but I just wish nigerians will have a bit patience with customer service delivery because like I told the guy on saturday  they are just working for the money they want to get not because they wanted to solve a challenge and secondly under estimating someone because you feel they are not as educated as you is quite appalling and we nigerians have to eradicate that mentality.... these are craftmen who specialize in solving people challenges and no idea is too little to overlook... but im glad as always my mechanic was able to rescue the so called educated technicians... Thank you for your time & PEK I hope you know this is not in anyway trying to defame you......

'I recently changed the flywhweel and torgue converter of my nissan primera P- car. Its year  wagon and engine size is .. CVT transmission. But the mechanic ignorantly and forcefully cut out the two wires on the connector on dropping resistor on the transmission when he separated engine from transmission during the repair work. The connector got stuck together and we had to remove the connector and join the wires only. I actually ran a scan before the connector wires were reconnected and got P. That time the car was driving with a lot of difficulties and the   sport   mode was unusually flashing on the dashboard. The part number of the dropping resistor is -E. But the connector that was conmected to a metal on the resistor was eventually removed before we could reconnect the wires back. After the wires were connected the car drives better  the   sport   mode flashing stopped and the code went away. The only issue left is that the CVT is not selecting properly again. No codes left after I re-scanned it. The car now drives without selecting the gears. Engine revs at RPM for car speed of /km/h as against RPM for car speed of /km/h before we did the flywheel/ converter replacement. I have drained the transmission oil two times and cleaned the magnetic filters and refill but there still no improvement. The transmission oil is still light red and clean for I changed around six months ago and the car has covered less than km.

Was driving on MB at night and all of a sudden the car could not accelerate anymore  checked the dash board and noticed the dash board lights were on and the brakes as well as steering started getting hard. I knew the car has just gone off. I managed to navigate to the edge of the bridge and switched off the car. Started the engine and the car started but went off immediately. Tried doing it again but this time around pressing the accelerator to rev the engine in order to stop it from going off again but the engine wont rev and car died. I Then called my mechanic and described what happened and he told me to check the filter in my airflow meter to confirm if it was torn and alas it was torn and worn out. Was told to remove the filter and start the car and to my greatest surprise everything was back in order and car moved fine. Drove it home with no issues after removing the torn filter. Had to go get a replacement filter this morning. Just to share this piece with my Infiniti FX users  never knew a torn filter would cause a car to behave like this way.Yes  all's well that ends well. Filter in airflow meter? What filter is that. Would you mean the common air filter?

'nissparts: The camshaft sensor replacement won't make any difference. Both codes means you have a problem in the timing chain area. The chains and gasket will need to be changed. He has intermittent low oil pressure from problems in this area and that's why the light is blinking. Symptoms will get worse eventually Yes  it's a timing chain area concern  but as no whine is evident yet I'll suggest the surgical operation of changing the chain mechanism altogether as a last resort. Apart from checking the crank and camshaft sensors  the factory service manual adds a third and final culprit which is   accumulation of debris to the signal pick-up portion of the camshaft.   Indeed the manual says in cases of intermittent incidents (as seems to be the case here) it might even be an electrical issue in which case you   check ground terminals for corroding or loose connection.                                           ,positive'
'You do realize that we do not have standards in fuel importation into the country. Hence the lowest grade is imported and then further adulterated. Thus your assumption on the fuel octane we run here may be wishful thinking. Open the fuel tank of any vehicle which has run for at least  months in Nigeria and you will be amazed at how dirty everything is including the fuel filter and the fuel itself. Numerous vehicles have been damaged just by buying fuel. Anyway  as far as I know  nothing you can do to meet the required premium standard.

'DJX: Are you sure its not just the effect of sheer volume of sales of the brands? More people are buying the regular Nissan products  so of course they will be more reported problems. Much fewer people buy the luxury Infinity brand  so there will also be naturally fewer complaints compaired to the regular Nissan products. Just my thots anyway.... Forget about the number of complaints for now  and look at the reason for their complaints...numbers are secondary  reason for the complaints  primary. Most common problems reported were...transmission issues  Radiator issues (leaking  overheating  coolant mixing with transmission)  excessive oil consumption  and Engine problems. However  from the Infiniti complaints  you'll hardly find the aforementioned problems  rather the type of problems they complained about were  accessories problems  eg: dashboard cracks  leather cracks on seats (common with the FX)  electrical problems on select models (G)  Brakes wearing out prematurely  and few other complaints  which in my opinion  are manageable! Let's put it this way  the Infiniti complaints are not as severe as the Nissan brand. It has nothing to do with sheer volume of sales...the problems are there. However  Nissan have tried to rectify some of those common problems on their newer models  but the question is: how many people can really afford to buy the newer models  especially in Africa  where everything is cash 'n' carry? EDIT: Before I got my Infiniti sedan  I really wanted an SUV...be it Pathfinder or Xterra  but after reading the horrible reviews about most Nissan products  I did the needful. I then started researching on their luxury brand...Infiniti  surprisingly  the reviews were ok  not perfect  but something I could live with. I then made up my mind to get the FX or FX  but I also got discouraged by the price  and also the cracking dashboards. I finally got the M sedan  which has the FX engine. A solid car  with loads of gadgets and ehh...gimmicks  the only problem; ground clearance is low  which means  some roads are prohibited. I have a second car for my daily movement  so I can live with that. Nissan products are generally flashy  hence; my initial attraction to the brand  but reliability is highly questionable! ,positive'

The  pathfinder have Torque:  ft-lbs. @  rpm Horsepower:  hp @  rpm which comes from a .L V with speed auto gear which pulls a  ibs/ kg RWD or  ibs/ .kg WD body.

Now from the data I've given above  I don't think the .L v of a  pathfinder can sit well inside the engine bay of the  pathfinder. Even if it does  you'll have to battle with all the sensors and ECU  gearbox  and differentials. If you're done  another big challenge comes which is how lazy the car will become  how boring and heavy the body of the  will be on the .L V  pathfinder  this will cause excessive fuel consumption  premature wear  and in no distant time  will cause engine damage.

Untill it   cools   for about  mins.  weeks ago  it stopped starting altogether. The engine cranks but wont start. I had it scanned and got a U message. I do not have accurate knowledge of previous issues with the car because it belonged to my late dad. While changing the oil some months ago  the mechanic noticed that the oil had a creamy color in the top cylinder. He said the top gasket was leaking and letting water into the oil. I had the top cylinder changed when the car was grounded. The vehicle usually had the non-start issue but there was a fix for that. Dad had a wire connected directly from the kick starter that could be placed on the battery terminal and the car would come to life. But now  that doesnt even work. Some of the electricians that have looked at the vehicle said the ECU (brainbox) was the problem. I bought another but the car still wont start. The ECU that was in the vehicle when bought isnt the branded Xtrail ECU. The connections there had been worked on before. So the new ECU didnt require any programming. Some pointed at the crank and cam sensors. I had those changed but still no start. I have changed all the plugs in the car ( cylinder). No change Changed the fuel pump. No change Please has anyone experienced this before? Is there a fix for it. Please help. I really need that vehicle to run my business                                         ,positive'

'Zeroid: Pls  kindly explain how dirty cabin filter can damage d evaporator. Just curious.Evaporator failures can usually be summed up in one word: leakage.This often happens because dust or other organic material enter the evaporator case when there is excess dirty on your cabin filter the worst case is when there is no cabin filter in the case. This moist atmosphere causes decomposition of the organic materials  and can form caustic corrosive substances which can eventually perforate the surface of the evaporator. These same substances can also sometimes lead to an odor problem inside the vehicle  most noticeable when the system is first operated. The evaporator fins are also likely to get clog from dust or organic materials. At time can cause your pipes to freeze up because your evaporator is clog and air can't pass through the thinning evaporator fins.                                       ,positive'

What are the symptoms you're experiencing? Why are you involving the ECU (ECM?)? Have you checked your throttle body for blockage of the throttle valve? The two sensor elements in the accelerator pedal appear to be dysfunctional  it just might be that you need a new one.

'Oga mosbus  kudos for the great work on this platform. Please I need your kind advice. When I bought my car (Camry ) in   the AC wasn't cooling well so I was advised to refill it (which I did). It worked well until about October   when I noticed it was no longer cooling as before. So I approached my AC man again to complain and he refilled the AC system again. We used R refrigerant both times. After the second filing  it worked for about one week and suddenly stopped cooling (the AC light would start blinking after about  seconds). I suspected there was a major leak somewhere. I never bothered about it (because I got no referral to another competent AC technician) until about three weeks ago. I was directed to another AC technician within my area. I explained to the guy and he did the following to determine where the leak is: (i) removed the compressor  filled it with one oil and refixed. He explained that he would be able to trace the leak from where the oil spills out; (ii) filled the system with a R refrigerant.  minutes into running the vehicle  we noticed that the AC began cooling but after a short while  it began blowing normal air. We observed a noise from the compressor area and the guy poured water on the compressor. It was so hot that he advised that I immediately switch off the AC. He concluded that the compressor is faulty and I'd need to change both the compressor and drier. Please advise. Thanks.                                     ,positive'

That's defamation of character. Your mechanic was there ALL the time and you were in constant touch with him. Did he say the car didn't start? So why will you use such words as claim and desperation? If I was desperate for anything  it was to see your car work. For those of you following drumma's FX issue  here is the update. I got interested in his issue when he mentioned he has tested several ECU and the car didn't start. I specifically told him that it is only the right one that will work. He contacted me and we agreed on me getting the brainbox from me. I sent someone to his place with the Right brainbox after it has been reprogrammed. Unfortunately  it didn't work. I told him we have to go with the scanner to detect the fault. Today is the fourth day and it is either we can't get the key or his mechanic won't be around. We even had to go with other brainbox to test. Today  we were able to trace the fault and rectify. The car started fine. His mechanic was surprised. We noticed the car wasn't performing optimally. It was discovered two nozzle were bad. Current was entering but it was not spraying. We interchanged the nozzle and got the same result. The mechanic was there all the time  relaying info to drumma.

'tkovie: I spoke to someone over here who told me he has it in stock  but before I thought of leaving to get it  I wanted to do a thorough check again to make sure I wasn't replacing something that isn't bad. I made another mechanic close to my house go under the car and check the sensors  he saw one at the front  close to the bumper disconnected. It has a green -pin plug. He connected it back and ensured that the back one was in place too. I decided to drive the car around for a few minutes if I'll notice any changes  but I only got a . MPG gain which was normal because the car was fluctuating between . MPG and  MPG in between use of regular and premium fuel. When I came back from the short test drive  I told him to disconnect the battery terminals  and replace them again (hoping to reset the whole system). He did that and when I checked my screen if there was any changes  the MPG was showing *.* (which was what I expected as he has just removed the battery terminals and the system has not been able to calculate the MPG since I've not driven it). The DTE (Distance To Empty) was on the same number before the terminal removal. So I told him I needed to drive the car for the whole day and check for changes which I did and I bought premium fuel. During the test drive  I noticed the MPG was increasing slowly which I expected  but to my surprise  later at night  I crossed my usual . and even my best of . MPG and recorded . MPG before I got home. Now  here's my question. Considering my increasing MPG  could there still be a problem? Are the sensors working as they should or do I still need to replace them. I could have gone to scan them but it costs alot and I was considering to get a cheap scanner instead of always going to pay for scanning. I found someone who sells the scanning software and USB cable that will enable me to use my laptop as a scanner. I don't know if that is reliable so I would need your advise. I believe the more I keep driving the car  the more MPG I'll get but one more thing is  the MPG starts reducing slowly too when I'm idling. Please let me know if there's anything I have to do next. PS: There's no catalyst in my car (it got burnt a while ago) Thanks tkovie: UPDATE: So far so good  I have recorded  MPG from my car MPG calculator. I also want to manually calculate it.

When I asked my mechanic  he said that's how its meant to work. Last year I had a  Camry V XLE. I love that car but the fans were always on (rolling). I was told it was to prevent overheating  although the relays had been tapered with before I had. Last month I bought a  Camry LE with a clean engine  neat relays with no wiring of any sort but my fans don't work like that of the Toyota Sienna I saw. Its always rolling. Are the fans meant to spin and stop automatically or my version was made that way? a toyota/lexus as well as most other car brands have radiator cooling fans which are designed to cycle off and on repeatedly to control temperature efficiently. That sienna's fan which cycles off and on is working correctly.                                    ,positive'

'shangy: Hello everyone  I'm considering buying the  Nissan Altima . SL v from Cotonou. Is this a good investment? My other option is the  Honda Accord  the price range is almost the same. Looking forward to your candid responses. Altima. is an i engine not v.  Altima outclasses the accord  in performance and styling with more mpg self not to talk of a  accord. You might have a problem with the spares and technical know-how compared to the accord. The Cvt might be another setback. I'm using the altima  presently and its a good car  would upgrade to a  model or Ford.                                         ,positive'

'mosbus: Before you refill gas into the air conditioning system.It is important to vacuum the system to remove any air or moisture that can cause harm to the system and also reduce the amount of gas quantity the system will take. By definition AIR occupy space. Air in the system reduce the cooling performance of the air condition and also allows the pipe to freeze up. Then the ice produce will dissolve and produce condense water. Condense water practically corrode the AC system e.g EVAPORATOR.

'kingschild: @idaraCHOBD The thermostat's job is relatively simple  but extremely important. It regulates the engine's operating temperature. It does this by restricting the flow of coolant from the engine back to the radiator. The thermostat is usually located in a housing where the upper radiator hose is connected to the engine. The thermostat is a valve that is held shut by spring tension. A wax filled thermal element in the thermostat opens the valve. As the engine begins to warm up and the coolant gets hot  the wax inside the sealed element expands and pushes the thermostat valve open. This occurs at a preset temperature (typically  degrees F. or so)  which is usually stamped on the thermostat itself. The thermostat should be fully open about  degrees F. above the rated temperature. The opening of the thermostat allows coolant to circulate through the engine and cooling system. As the temperature of the coolant begins to drop  the wax element cools off and contracts allowing the thermostat to partially or fully close. Thus  by cycling open and shut a relatively constant operating temperature is maintained.I have changed my thermostat before it aint a lazy mans Job what becomes the void left in its place?                                     ,positive'

'ALIGNMENT: That might be an alignment problem (which also might irregularly and prematurely wear your tires). Maybe an alignment would solve that problem  or you might have worn steering parts (such as a worn ball joint). You can check the alignment parts yourself  by jacking up the car and wiggling the tires (but be aware that tires should wiggle a bit anyway). What you are looking for is unusual movement in any steering part. GRABBING BRAKES: It is possible that the problem is in the braking system (something might be sticking). Perhaps you have a warped caliper (which can warp from heat if the rotors get too thin to properly dissipate heat)? You can test which brakes (front or back) are causing the problem by applying just the rear brakes alone using the emergency brake (but just slightly apply the emergency brake so it doesn't grab).

'A/C Compressors: Why the right oil matters A/C Compressor oil is the biggest cause of product failure. Maintenance and repair of automotive air-conditioning (A/C) units  either manually or automatically controlled  represent a real expansion opportunity for garages and workshops. Indepth technical knowledge of A/C systems  common faults  recommended components and oils are all essential to achieve customer satisfaction and build return business. Central to this technical know-how is a comprehensive knowledge of compressors. This is because .% of all compressor problems are not related to product failure  but from a poor understanding of A/C system operation  maintenance and repair. But there is one aspect in particular that causes the majority of avoidable A/C Compressor problems is the oil. Universal oil: a key cause of compressor failure Compressors are vital to a vehicleâ€™s A/C system; compressing the low temperature  low pressure gaseous refrigerant from the evaporator  into a high temperature  high pressure gaseous refrigerant  and discharging it to the condenser. Oil in the A/C system is essential  primarily to lubricate moving parts  i.e. the compressor and the expansion valve needle. It also enables heat to escape from the compressor. As with refrigerant  oil in the A/C system must retain its chemical stability. However  it is vital to choose the right oil for the job. Insufficient lubrication due to universal oil is the second most frequent reason for A/C compressor damage and failure. What are the pitfalls of universal oil? The use of incorrect oils  such as universal oils or oil mixtures  inevitably leads to A/C compressor damage. This is because universal oils  often preferred by garages  are PAO-oils  or mineral oils with a different viscosity than synthetic PAG-oils. The difference between these two types of oil means that they do not mix  leading to poor lubrication  damaged seals and increased wear. If the oil is diluted  the lubricant base layer decreases. This results in the piston rubbing against the cylinder bearing surface. If the oil is too thick  it is unable to â€˜squeezeâ€™ between the cylinder and the piston. change in the oil viscosity can result in more frictional resistance  leading to an increase in compressor temperature and subsequent seizure. Blending or mixing of different types of oils may lead to the formation of paraffin. This can block the flow of the refrigerant and oil  leading to seizure of the compressor and system failure. Quantity as important as quality It is not only the quality  but the quantity of oil in the system that is of great importance. Too little oil leads to poor lubrication of the compressor  rising component temperature and oil scorching on the suction side of the compressor. Too much oil in the system will increase the load on the piston-crank system  which can lead to a block in the body of the thrust bearing and the hard front piston co-pivotable skid plate. Is the oil filtered? It is also essential that any solid impurities in the compressor oil are removed in the filter-dryer. The filter-dryer will also capture moisture from the oil. As part of the annual maintenance of the A/C system  it is equally vital to remove a proportion of the oil  replacing it with the same quantity of fresh oil.              ,positive'

But you know it is you i will still run to so if you like boss kill me with dictionary na you go still take your right hand help me.... Back to the bone of contention.... What I basically do is relay what information i gather from my mechanic on one side and PEK's people on the other side. I remember pasting the part number of the ECM installed the following but you may have skipped it so here it is again: EMC: K MEC-  X That's what they presently installed and you asked about the programming of the key to which i also responded that i don't have any spare and ask if there might be any issue in the future. II: about the injector nozzles  like i said when they fixed the ecm and the car wasn't working well it was PEK and his BOYS that dogmatically said it was the injector nozzles that were bad because they werent spraying.... so they billed me another k and they had that fixed on saturday morning between : & : am as soon as they finished that they started the car and it still wasn't working fine then PEK's guy again said its not longer the nozzles that the VALVE was bad and that my mechanic should go and work on that.... that was what led to the hr argument that ensued until my mechanic detected that it was the cables they didn't position well. and they got that right and the car started fine.... now scanning the system that day the car came up with the :U CODE and it was the same code my mechanic said he got yesterday. lastly my mechanic said he hasn't gotten new plugs so i cannot provide the inscriptions yet....

In fact  during the -year existence of the S-Class  no four-cylinder mill has ever found a home in its engine bay. That is  until now.

The high torque  combined with its  horsepower  enables the four-cylinder-equipped S  CDI BlueEfficiency to run from - in a reasonable . seconds. Not too shabby for a diesel  eh? Fuel consumption comes in at . liters per  kilometers  or about . miles per U.S. gallon on Europe's generous testing cycle; CO emissions trickle out at a class-leading  g/km. Though Mercedes has no plans to offer the turbo'd four in U.S.-bound S-Class models  the mere existence of this diesel mill  coupled with the fact that it is found in the company's flagship model  shows us that the drive for better fuel efficiency affects even some of those top-shelf luxo-barges.

'xerotop: @ nissparts  thx  d response. I saw ur posts on a nissan thread. I cld conclude u have a garage for nissan and infinity repairs & mtnce. its good to av u around just in case. Lols. Back to the discussion  if octane booster will not work  whats d way out of fuel not meeting the standard. As u know d FX needs a minimum of % octane rating. Kindly suggest wot to do. Octane rating in nigeria is btw  and . Definetely needs boosting if i want to enjoy my '. I think Also for correction purpose; Atf needed for fx is nissan matic J and not nissan matic s as i ealier stated above. It was a typo. These cars have knock sensors which can slowpoke the timing if the octane sensor is low to prevent engine knock.. U wont notice the difference. The question is how low octane can you go.                                         ,positive'

A mechanic once worked on it when I had a little accident & welded one broken iron rod like that  but it is now bent & the tyre has assumed an abnormal orientation .

Sorry  if my questions sound somehow but i'm just confused and i don't want to make any mistake in my selection This reminds me when my sister came to me  to help her choose a car to buy. While listing out cars  I mentioned Toyota xyz. Before I could finished  she was like    Excuse me!   Lol! Do you get it now? So  it depends on you. Most ladies would choose what everyone drives  but few would be like    I don't want this  I want that!   And my sister is truly enjoying what she ended up with  with my guidance. Funny enough  the car has been very faithful to her. Never let her stranded or cost her fortune to keep on the road. So  again  do you still want me to talk about how to live a boring live behind the wheel or you want me to talk to you about how to live a good life behind the wheel and become a Lioness while at it?

Is the issue of low octane in our petrol more damagin to the s than the s or is there any reason why one shouldnt pick a  above a  (other than the slightly higher fuel consumption)? thks I personally do not think there is any reason for picking a  over . Low octane rating if it will have any effect on the car will definetly have to do with both engines. I think its just the mentality of wanting to drive a powerful and big car  and not wanting to buy fuel. I read frm a forum that d diff in mpg is not up to or more than  mpg. And come to think of it  u can not compare wot u will get ind  to dat of . More options  more power and lots more. Peolple tend to run away wen they hear and see that its a v.

Lastly  how do I know if I should change the transmission fluid and service it  the car seems to find it difficult before it enters th gear. ThanksDid you say k kilometres? That's less than k miles. Even at k miles the engine still has a lot of life in it. The VQ engine that you have uses a timing chain and not belt  so you need not be unduly worried about snapping; just ensure that your engine oil is always on gauge. As for the decreased fuel efficiency you've observed  the car probably need tune ups: good new engine filter  plugs  pcv valve  etc. Yes  it's not a bad idea to change the transmission fluid. I believe your car is speed transmission  in which case you'd need Nissan Matic D transmission fluid.                         ,positive'

My right back tyre is touching the body & abnormally bent inwards. The car is low on this side. A mechanic once worked on it when I had a little accident & welded one broken iron rod like that  but it is now bent & the tyre has assumed an abnormal orientation . Car makes a lot of screeching noise when driving slowly which is usually worsened by applying brakes. I had the brake pads changed and it persisted. A mechanic told me my inner cross/crux is bad  he brought it out & it was actually bad but I couldn't get a replacement  so he repaired the bad one  I only noticed a slight improvement. .

Are you sure its not just the effect of sheer volume of sales of the brands? More people are buying the regular Nissan products  so of course they will be more reported problems.

'pek: For those of you following drumma's FX issue  here is the update. I got interested in his issue when he mentioned he has tested several ECU and the car didn't start. I specifically told him that it is only the right one that will work. He contacted me and we agreed on me getting the brainbox from me. I sent someone to his place with the Right brainbox after it has been reprogrammed. Unfortunately  it didn't work. I told him we have to go with the scanner to detect the fault. Today is the fourth day and it is either we can't get the key or his mechanic won't be around. We even had to go with other brainbox to test. Today  we were able to trace the fault and rectify. The car started fine. His mechanic was surprised. We noticed the car wasn't performing optimally. It was discovered two nozzle were bad. Current was entering but it was not spraying. We interchanged the nozzle and got the same result. The mechanic was there all the time  relaying info to drumma. How is it brainbox? Hm.Didn't realize Part II was going to start almost immediately. Kidding. I don't want to be a cast in the plot  I'm just interested in learning. So my observations are these: (i) Were the two nozzles bad before the new repairs? (ii) Could it be that those nozzles are not now optimally operational because the ecm is defective in the relevant section? (iii) What did you determine was the vehicle's fault?

'Kingsteve: Forget about the number of complaints for now  and look at the reason for their complaints...numbers are secondary  reason for the complaints  primary. Most common problems reported were...transmission issues  Radiator issues (leaking  overheating  coolant mixing with transmission)  excessive oil consumption  and Engine problems. However  from the Infiniti complaints  you'll hardly find the aforementioned problems  rather the type of problems they complained about were  accessories problems  eg: dashboard cracks  leather cracks on seats (common with the FX)  electrical problems on select models (G)  Brakes wearing out prematurely  and few other complaints  which in my opinion  are manageable! Let's put it this way  the Infiniti complaints are not as severe as the Nissan brand. It has nothing to do with sheer volume of sales...the problems are there. However  Nissan have tried to rectify some of those common problems on their newer models  but the question is: how many people can really afford to buy the newer models  especially in Africa  where everything is cash 'n' carry? EDIT: Before I got my Infiniti sedan  I really wanted an SUV...be it Pathfinder or Xterra  but after reading the horrible reviews about most Nissan products  I did the needful. I then started researching on their luxury brand...Infiniti  surprisingly  the reviews were ok  not perfect  but something I could live with. I then made up my mind to get the FX or FX  but I also got discouraged by the price  and also the cracking dashboards. I finally got the M sedan  which has the FX engine. A solid car  with loads of gadgets and ehh...gimmicks  the only problem; ground clearance is low  which means  some roads are prohibited. I have a second car for my daily movement  so I can live with that. Nissan products are generally flashy  hence; my initial attraction to the brand  but reliability is highly questionable! Lol  I see your point sha  makes sense.... ,positive'

'Osolo: Quick question please  why different tire specs for the front and rear of the same car? Wouldn't this result in a form of unbalance? Curious to know more. Thanks It won't cause any balance. It's called Staggered Wheels. The front wheels are a little smaller with bigger tyres. The rear wheels are bigger with small tyres . All tyres are the same in length. So the car will still ride smoothly. But don't run Staggered wheels on Awd. It will damage your tranny or drive shaft                                           ,positive'

Since you forded water with it at the turn of a steering  there is a wheezing noise. Does the steering feel hard  can you zero in on where the noise comes from (whether its from the power steering pump  the belt  or from the wheel area  or the steering rack and pinion (that's if your car uses rack and pinion))? Yea... The steering does feel hard. I'm sorry; I really don't know what a rack and pinion is and I am yet to actually identify where the noise is coming from... Costee: What do you mean by   the language on the screen  ? Are you referring to the info display screen? Should that be the case  then your car is P  and not P. I want to believe too that if it is P it will have a feature in the menu for conversion into English language. Since you attribute the issues you're having to the wheels/steering  it just could be that the problem is mechanical. [Check the steering rack for example.] If electrical the MIL (check engine light) should be on. (You should be able to identify that icon). Better still  have the car scanned nonetheless.[quote author=Costee] Yes... Its the info display screen. I can only see options in French and Dutch. No English option. The check engine light is off.
